            <nav>
                <p>Hey! My name is Joel and I'm a 27 year old student in the 201 class. I was born in Canada and I have lived in the United States, specifically in Texas, since 2005. I have two years of college under my belt but my work background comes from my court reporting and paralegal jobs in the Marine Corps. I was in the Marine Corps for 4 years and I was stationed at Parris Island, South Carolina.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My current goals are to finish this class and move on to a career in the tech industry, hopefully somewhere out of Texas so I can see a bit more of the US. My goals outside of my career would be to get another dog so my Chihuahua has a pal and to adopt a kid or two.</p>
